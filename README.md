GRBAS_Mate is a free app interface that allows users to listen to numerous examples of different voice dysfunctions and associate them with expert benchmark. 
It is created for home assessment, but can serve as an assistance tool in diagnosis for professional context, too. 
This first version will provide sample recordings of several parameters according to the commonly used GRBAS scale with different severity levels. 
The app is currently under development.
The development of this app is part of the study "Auditory Training and Assessment of Dysphonic Voice Quality" by Kudera et. al.
